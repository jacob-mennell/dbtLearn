### Models in dbt

1. **Raw Data (Source Models):** Raw data models are responsible for extracting and loading data from source systems into your data warehouse. They might perform basic data transformation and validation, but their main goal is to ingest data as-is.

2. **Staging Models:** Staging models are used to further transform and prepare data after it's been ingested from source systems. They might perform tasks like data type casting, renaming columns, and handling null values. Staging models serve as an intermediate step before data is loaded into analytical tables.

3. **Intermediate Models (Transformations):** Intermediate models apply complex transformations to your data, such as aggregations, joins, pivots, and calculations. These models create reusable "views" of your data, making it easier to query and analyze without duplicating logic.

4. **Analytical Models (Dimensional and Fact Models):** Analytical models define the structure of your data for analytical purposes. Dimensional models represent business entities and hierarchies, such as customers, products, and time. Fact models represent business events and transactions. These models support efficient querying for reporting and analysis.

5. **Snapshot Models:** Snapshot models capture historical changes in data over time. They're useful for tracking changes in dimensions, attributes, and metrics. Snapshot models provide insights into how data evolves and is affected by changes.

6. **Test Models:** Test models ensure data quality and integrity by running checks on your data. These checks can include detecting duplicates, missing values, or other anomalies. Test models help maintain data quality throughout the ETL process.

7. **Seed Models:** Seed models provide initial data to populate your tables. They're often used for reference data that doesn't change frequently, like lookup tables or reference codes.

8. **Archive Models:** Archive models move historical or deprecated data to an archive table, keeping your main tables lean and improving performance. Archive models are especially useful in scenarios where data retention requirements exist.

9. **Macro Models:** Macro models define reusable code snippets, often used to simplify complex transformations or calculations across multiple models. They enhance maintainability and consistency in your dbt project.

These model types in dbt help you organize and manage your data transformation process efficiently, ensuring data quality, consistency, and ease of analysis.
